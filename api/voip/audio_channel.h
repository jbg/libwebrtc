// AudioChannel is made up of two implementation detail classes;
// namely AudioIngress and AudioEgress.
//
//  - AudioIngress mainly handles incoming RTP/RTCP packets from remote
//    endpoint through its own acm2::AcmReceiver. Its role is similar
//    to ChannelReceive in that it is AudioMixer::Source and will
//    provide audio sample to play as requested by AudioDeviceModule.
//    Though its usage on RtpRtcp is limited, it provides clarity and
//    better logical division that it has the shared RtpRtcp instance.
//
//  - AudioEgress is the implementation that receives the process
//    input samples from AudioDeviceModule through AudioTransportImpl.
//    Once it encodes the sample via selected encoder, resulted data
//    will be packetized by RTP stack, resulting in ready-to-send RTP
//    packet to remote endpoint.
//
// Note that the instance of RtpRtcp is shared among all three classes.
// Though send and receive logic can be nicely divided into two separate
// classes, there still is some logic that would require orchestration
// between the two. In media recv-only use case, RTCP is still expected
// to be transmitted and thus the rtp stack needs to be set to sending
// in recv-only mode; that is AudioEgress is not active but only AudioIngress
// is. AudioChannel has the shared instance of rtp stack to control it
// as it inhertits both implementations. In the similar reason, we have
// overridden Start* and Stop* method from these parents. Note also
// that since RtpRtcp is shared among three classes, it's easier to
// maintain the destruction sequence by using std::shared_ptr.
//
// It's also possible to make this composite relationship instead but
// it would require AudioChannel to open up APIs for all AudioIngress/Egress
// resulting in noisy interfaces. Since AudioIngerss/Egress are indeed
// just implementation details, it's more fitting to regard this as
// 'as-is' relationship.
