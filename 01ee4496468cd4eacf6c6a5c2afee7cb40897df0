Also, we will run out of payload types soon if we are supposed to add corresponding stereo codecs for every real codec.\n\nAre you planning to use anything other than VP9 for your stereo support? Can\u0027t you call this codec \"stereo-vp9\" and make it completely external instead?",

Associated codec(VPX-H264) that comes with it is going to be specified by a param, see codec.cc.\n\nI am going to add other types than VP9 as well. But for the first CL, I want to just do one, to keep the CL small and avoid SDP negotiation, mismatch issues. I can add all if you wish in the first run as well.",
