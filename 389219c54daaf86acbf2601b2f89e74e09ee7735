      "message": "Hello.\n\nWhich existing RTCConfiguration option are you talking about?\n\nThis new option doesn\u0027t disable intranet. It tells the code to not try to enumerate and probe the interfaces, and instead use the default one (whatever is the default for the OS). In case of iOS it works, because it stops trying to access the link-local interface, and starts using the right interface quicker.",

      "message": "Thanks for your patience. I had to go review the Chromium code to understand how this situation is handled in Chromium, which is trying to solve a similar problem. As it turns out, Chromium injects its own NetworkManager where it controls enumeration via the enumeration_permission function, which is admittedly awkward for typical WebRTC applications.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s take a step back. \n1) It\u0027s not clear to me that having a link-local address is actually a problem - connectivity will still proceed on the other addresses.\n2) If we believe that optimizing away link-local candidates is a useful optimization, I would focus on solving that problem, rather than disabling enumeration entirely. Disabling enumeration is designed for a different purpose and has several downsides (e.g. preventing p2p connectivity for users on the same network).\n3) If, regardless, we think there\u0027s a good reason to expose this for its intended purpose (i.e., controlling which addresses are exposed to the app), it should be global, and therefore an option on PeerConnectionFactory::Options rather than on an individual PeerConnection.",
